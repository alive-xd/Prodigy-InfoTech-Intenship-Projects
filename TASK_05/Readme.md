## Network Packet Analyzer

This Python program is a basic packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network packets. It extracts and displays relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and payload data. Designed for educational purposes, it emphasizes ethical use and requires user consent before operation.

### Features

- **Packet Sniffing**: 
  - Captures TCP network packets in real-time.
  
- **Detailed Analysis**: 
  - Extracts and displays key information from each packet, including:
    - Source and Destination IP addresses
    - Source and Destination Ports
    - Protocol
    - Payload data (first 50 characters)
  
- **Output Logging**: 
  - Saves the captured packet details to a text file for later review.
  
- **Ethical Use Disclaimer**: 
  - Includes a disclaimer outlining the ethical use of the tool and requires user acceptance of terms and conditions.

### Usage

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to start the packet sniffer.
2. **Read and Accept Disclaimer**: Carefully read the disclaimer and accept the terms and conditions to continue.
3. **Packet Capture and Analysis**: The program will capture and analyze TCP packets on the network.
4. **Review Log**: After capturing the specified number of packets, the details will be saved to a text file named `packet_sniffer_results.txt`.

This tool was developed as part of my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, demonstrating the creation of a network packet analyzer for educational purposes.
