## Simple Keylogger

This Python program implements a basic keylogger that records and logs keystrokes. Designed as an educational tool, it demonstrates how keylogging works while emphasizing ethical considerations by requiring user consent before running.

### Features

- **Key Logging**: 
  - Records every keystroke along with a timestamp.
  
- **Log File**: 
  - Saves the logged keystrokes to a specified file.
  
- **User Consent**: 
  - Includes a disclaimer requiring user acceptance of terms and conditions before proceeding.
  
- **Duration Control**: 
  - Allows users to specify the duration for which keystrokes should be logged.

### Usage

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to start the keylogger.
2. **Read and Accept Disclaimer**: Carefully read the disclaimer and accept the terms and conditions to continue.
3. **Specify Duration**: Enter the duration (in seconds) for which the keylogger should operate.
4. **Logging Keystrokes**: The program will capture and log keystrokes during the specified period.
5. **Review Log**: After the duration ends, the log file containing the keystrokes will be saved, and its location will be displayed.

This tool was developed as part of my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, serving as a practical example of keylogging while promoting ethical use and the importance of user consent.
