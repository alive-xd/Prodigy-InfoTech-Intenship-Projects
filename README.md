# Prodigy InfoTech Cybersecurity Internship Projects

This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity projects developed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The projects include implementations of Caesar Cipher, Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption, Keylogger, Password Complexity Checker, and Network Packet Analyzer.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Caesar Cipher Implementation

**Description:**  
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

**Working:**
- The user inputs a plaintext message and a shift value.
- Each letter in the message is shifted by the specified value.
- The resulting ciphertext is displayed.

### 2. Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

**Description:**  
Pixel Manipulation involves altering the pixels of an image to encrypt the data within the image.

**Working:**
- The user inputs an image file.
- The program applies specified manipulations to encrypt the image data.
- The encrypted image is saved and displayed.

### 3. Keylogger

**Description:**  
A Keylogger is a program that records every keystroke made by a user, often used for monitoring purposes.

**Working:**
- The program runs in the background and captures all keystrokes.
- The captured keystrokes are saved to a log file.
- The log file can be accessed to review the recorded keystrokes.

### 4. Password Complexity Checker

**Description:**  
The Password Complexity Checker evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, complexity, and the inclusion of special characters.

**Working:**
- The user inputs a password.
- The program assesses the password against defined strength criteria.
- A complexity score and feedback are provided to help improve the password's security.

### 5. Network Packet Analyzer

**Description:**  
A Network Packet Analyzer captures and analyzes network packets to monitor network traffic and diagnose issues.

**Working:**
- The program captures network packets in real-time.
- The captured packets are analyzed to extract useful information.
- The analysis results are displayed, including details like source and destination IP addresses, protocols used, and data payloads.
